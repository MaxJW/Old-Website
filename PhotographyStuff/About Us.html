        <p>Welcome to Photography++! We are a group of students at the University of Dundee, who are passionate about the art, technique and skill of Photography in its various forms. We are aiming to share our knowledge with other people of all skill levels, and help spread the joy of this beautiful skill. In this website we have included a wealth of information to do just that! There are three main sections to the website – Equipment, Techniques and Editing. “Equipment” is designed to share our opinion on the best gear to get to help you on your photography journey, irrespective of experience level. The “Techniques” section is the meat and potatoes of our website. This is where you will find detailed tutorials of the fundamental methods of the form. We want to share our knowledge on these techniques to help you become a better photographer. No photograph is complete without a makeover, and that is where the “Editing” section comes in. We will help you learn to use the latest software to help you brush up your images (no pun intended.) and make them well presented and professional. Thank you for visiting Photography++. We hope you found our website valuable and informative. Best of luck on your photography journey. Craig, Max, Minghui and Peter.
